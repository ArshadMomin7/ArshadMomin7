### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Arshad, I am a Optimistic Engineer with 3 years Programming experience. My biggest acheivement was being able to Develop inspection software for visual identification for Defence Research and Development organization (DRDO) and INDIAN SPACE RESEARCH ORGANISATION (ISRO) for SPACE Applications. 

As a TECHNICAL ENGINEER, I started my professional career in 2019. Since then, I have worked on numerous projects that have helped introduce new technologies to the market and have developed software for visual identification systems for three years. I was in charge of analyzingÂ quality flaws using visual inspection systems, creating and programming systems in accordance with inspection software, suggesting fresh ideas to enhance performance and optimizeÂ the design following correction, directing a group of four people to innovate, create, and provide adequate software applications depending on the requirement. Conducted Quality testing for all new development projects, Verifying technical specifications created by the team, and monitoring teams in India, the UK, and Japan.

I started my graduate studies in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Waterloo in January 2022. I was able to maximise and raise my software-related talents to a new level here. I'm currently seeking for a position as a software engineer so that I can sharpen my technical abilities and demonstrate my developer abilities.
